## Fldigi Notes

### Customize the Fldigi Apps

As I mentioned earlier, for those of you who were running an earlier Nexus DR-X image, you can restore your backed-up home folder from the previous image and not have to set up Fldigi, etc. as described here.

1. In Fldgi: __Configure > UI > Operator__.  Note you have to do this for both the __Fldigi (Left Radio)__ *and* __Fldigi (Right Radio)__ menu items.

1. In Flmsg: __Config > Personal__ tab.  Note that you have to do this for both the __Flmsg (Left Radio)__ *and* __Flmsg (Right Radio)__ menu items.

1. See the [Nexus Audio](https://github.com/AG7GN/nexus-audio/blob/main/README.md) documentation about how Fldigi uses PulseAudio and the Fe-Pi, as well as information on how to set up audio alerts. Recent versions of Fldigi have changed the way aduio levels are depicted in the waterfall and signal displays sometimes making input audio appear too high when that may not be the case. 

### FSQ on Fldigi
